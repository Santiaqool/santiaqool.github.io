#### Welcome to A Fast Summary of My Life!

### Who Are You?

I'm Hasan, I am a math major at the Bogazici University which is located in Turkey. I am interested in programming, data science and of course MATH!

### How and When Did You Start Programming?

Well, I was curious about computers when I was a child. So, I started to look for things that I can learn in that age. I did some crazy stuffs like basic HTML web sites ect... **They were harder than this :)**. After my junior years I met the deep programming languages in my technichal high school years. I developed my algorithmic thinking and my programming skills. After that I got qualified to study in my current university. I met very crazy guys like me and enjoyed every moment. I continued to learn programming and I am still doing it!

### Then What is Your Experience Based on Certain Programming Languages?

I started programming with basic web developing syntaxes like HTML and CSS. Then to improve my websites I learned how to use JQuary. After That I got introduced with .NET and used it to build web sites. I also got into a bit PHP. In the desktop side I learned C#,C++ and Python and used them to built some desktop applications. I even built a game with C++!! I am also interested in data so I am currently using some great Python libraries to manupilate and analyze big datas.

### That is Great but What About Your Life Outside of Programming?

Well of course I am in love with computers and coding but there is a lot space in my heart. I am a professional athlete in my university team. I like running distances. Also I am a former professional swimmer. In the future I want to participate in Ironman Tournements!. Well when I am done with my trainings and codings, I spent some of my time to ART!. I have been learning piano for 2 years now and you cannot believe how good I am when I playing some of the cool songs.

### Do You Have Some Final Words For This Question Part?
