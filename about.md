# Welcome to The Fast Summary of My Life!

### Who Are You?

I'm Hasan, I am a math major at the Bogazici University which is located in Turkey. I am interested in programming, data science and of course MATH!

### How and When Did You Start Programming?

Well, I was curious about computers when I was a child. So, I started to look for things that I can learn in that age. I did some crazy stuffs like basic HTML web sites ect... ( They were harder than this :) ) After my junior years I met the deep programming languages in my technichal high school years. I developed my algorithmic thinking and my programming skills. After that I got qualified to study in my current university. I met very crazy guys like me and enjoyed every moment. I continued to learn programming and I am still doing it!
